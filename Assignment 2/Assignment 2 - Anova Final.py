# 
#       The code is divided into sections to make the reading process easier for you. Moreover, very detailed explanations are made for  
# in each section to explain newly introduced parts.
#       Our effort in this project focused in 3 parts:    
#           1. Routing of the vans
#           2. Introducing a new charging policy
#           3. Changing the speed to the stochastic speed
#
# Thanks to the routing of the vans, the model is adapted to multiple vans trying to optimize their routes. For 8 hours tour period and 35kwh battery size
# 4 vans are enough to complete the tour, even without charging. Thats why, to make the problem more challenging in order to force the vans to charge,
# the battery size can be changed. You can check new codes in "3. Routing of the vans for 60 customers and multiple vans" part.
# 
# Secondly, a new charging policy is introduced by us. Having detected the drawbacks of the current policy (e.g. going to the closest charging station
# is not necessarily the best choice if it has a very long queue), we introduced a new charging policy, to improve the performance of the last
# mile delivery. You can check new codes in "4. New functions about the new charging station selection policy"
#
# Also, the battery sizes are changed to support giving different battery sizes to different vans, by introducing
# battery size array as battery_size=[x,y,z,t] which shows the battery sizes of vans from 0 to 3
#
# lastly, the van capacities are introduced, depending on the number of customers served and average order weight. Tn this
# way the current load weights of the vans can be seen, which decreases after visiting customers. This is not printed
# due to the space constraint of the python console;however, you can go to the related section and can print it.
#
# To code these 5 parts, both new functions are introduced, and also some existing functions are modified. All the changes will be explained in detail
# in the related parts of the code.
# 
# 
# Additionally, in this script single factor experiments will be conducted using oneway anova test. 
# Experiment will be done by fixing one factor and changing level for other factor
# From Anova test result, the signifiance of factors on the system performance measure which is ax tour end times are observed.
#

    # to be the distances of the arcs. In this way we can define the best routing possible by first creating a distance dimension
    # which computes the cumulative distance traveled by each vehicle along its route. Then we set a cost proportional to the 
    # maximum of the total distances along each route. In this part we set a large coefficient (200) for the global span of the 
    # routes, which is the maximum of the distances of the routes. This makes the global span the predominant factor in the

                                                                     ### as the distances of the arcs.

# for which we can obtain the minimum longest distance of the route. As a matter of fact if we introduce one or 
# more additional vans, the program will make one of them remain at the warehouse since it is not possible to
# optimize the routing more because by introducing one or more vans the longest route percurred by a van, in 
# terms of Km, will be the same or greater.

                                        # 5. NEW FUNCTIONS ABOUT THE NEW CHARGING STATION SELECTION POLICY       


# Our new charging station selection decision making policy improves the performance by two ways:
    
#   1. Choosing THE BEST CHARGING STATION: Choosing the CLOSEST CHARGING STATION is NOT necessarily the best option. 
#   In fact, if a very long queue is accumulated at that specific charging station, even if it is the closest one, 
#   our van will lose huge amount time. So, it will help us choosing the best option, not necessarily the closest one
#   by taking into account:
    
#       1.a. Extra travelling time compared to the original route 
#            (If the charging station is located in between the van and the next customer, this value is 0)
#
#       1.b. Expected waiting time at different charging stations (determined by probability calculations)  
#            (EXPECTED because the calculations are made BEFORE going to a charging station, to choose the best one)
#
#   The trade-offs between these 2 features (1.a. and 1.b.) determines which is the most convenient station
#   for a given van for a given time. Even if a charging station is the closest one (low extra travelling time)
#   it may have very high expected waiting time, making it a worse option.

#   2. Charging 20% of the battery size is NOT necessarily the best option. We can calculate the ENERGY NEEDED, and charge
#   this amount. This ENERGY NEEDED will be calculated in advance, given that the routes (consequently the travelling
#   distance) are known in advance for every single van. This will prevent time spent for unncessary charging 

   
# This policy can be easily implemented by companies using a mobile app with the features: 
    
#   . Getting the real time data about the location of the van, the location and 
#     the current queues of charging stations and the routing
#   . Making real-time decisions for the van driver, to select the most convenient charging station
#     and charging amount



# THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS NEW CHARGINg POLICY can easily be seen by tracking the actual waiting times of the vans at charging stations,
# which are in many cases "0", thanks to this new policy. Sometimes you can see the van wait more than 0 minutes,
# which is due to another car coming before our van. So, even though there is still some stochasticity that may cause
# some waiting time in the queue, our policy helps minimizing it. This issue will be deepened in the Assignment 2. 



# Below, we tried to explain the new functions supporting this policy as detailed as possible.
# After the explanation part finishes, you will see the functions.
# If there is still something not clear to you, please do not hesitate to contact to us.


# NEW FUNCTIONS:
    

# 5.1 "Extra_distance_time":    
# Explaning how much extra travel distance time will be needed, compared to the 
# original route. Once 
# If the charging station is located in between the vanâ€™s current location and the next customer,
# this score will be low, meaning that visiting this specific charging station do not make us lose any time, in terms of
# travelled distance. 
# So: the LOWER it is, the BETTER that charging station

# 5.2 "expected_waiting_time":    
# This part is making probability calculations to find out how long the van will wait in the queue to be served by the charging station. 
# The LOWER this score, the BETTER the charging station.

# The variables such as the ones below are taken into account to make these calculations:
# a. Current position of the van 
# b. Current waiting times of the charging stations (The higher it is, the higher our van will wait in the queue)
# c. Positions of the charging stations (The closer it is to our van, it is less likely that another car come before us )
# d. Parameters : expected charging time (25 minutes) and expected arrival times (1/45 uniform distribution)

# FOR EXAMPLE: 
#If a charging station has 10 minutes of current waiting time, and the van is
# arriving there in 5 minutes, the expected waiting time will be:
# (Probability of a car arriving in 5 minutes * expected charging time of that car) +
# (Current waiting Time (queue) of that charging station â€“ Travelling Time to the Charging Station)  = (5/45)*(25)+(10-5)

# These type of calculations are made for different scenarios. This will help the van to choose the most
# convenient charging station. However, "extra_travel_distance" function above is also important, not only
# "expected_waiting_time". Their scores will be combined in the "charging_station_score" function

# This calculations are made with respect to the parameters of this specific assignment. If companies want to adjust
# this code to their own cases
# (e.g. if instead of uniform arrivals, they have normal distribution of arrivals in the charging statios) , they can
# do their own calculations, and still use this idea.

#!! NOTE: The success of our policy can be seen in the "waiting_times_van" matrix, in which you can see in many cases
# our van waits "0" minutes, thanks to accuracy of our calculations, to choose the charging station that will make us
# wait as short as possible. In the Assignment 2, specific attention will be paid to this issue, comparing it with
# the Base Case policy.
